This is the repository for my sample project 'My Sims'

Notes for everyone who has the 'My Sims' project files :

* Before opening the projects files in Unity, make sure to delete the 'Library' folder or 
reimport all of the assets using Unity to fix the package errors (EventSystem error).
* The executable files are compressed inside the folder Setup Files Folder.
* The document for the whole project is located in Documents Folder folder.

THANK YOU
